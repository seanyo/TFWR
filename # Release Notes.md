# Release Notes

Started at v1.6.0-pumpkins. No previous notes

## v1.6.0-pumpkins

- The overall structure of using unlocks for versions seems sufficient. Feels like there's a better way, but I'll likely need to finish the game to see that better way
- The timing of each branch was on unlock - but I don't think I've been exhausting the opporutnity for each unlock
- starting with this branch, I'm going to focus on "finishing" an unlock before merging it back into main. 

### The Big Unlock
- Hit a tipping point in resource gen that allowed some investment of run time to produce enough mats to mostly unlock the game.
